# README

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. I had to implement a authentication system so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.
The task was to build an exclusive clubhouse where the members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
I have used Devise for authentication and Bulma for styling. I deployed the app to Heroku.
You can see it live at the URL posted in the About section.
